# resume-portfolio
My resume and portfolio for career development and sharing resources 

Goal is to share some of my existing notes created in Obsidian.md to my personal domain (michaelweisser.com); use a static-website generator such as Hugo or Jekyll to create the GitHub hosted static-website.

Extensive file properties entered in the YAML frontmatter of each markdown file prior to upload.

Nice bonus to have some of my cheatsheets available on michaelweisser.com.
